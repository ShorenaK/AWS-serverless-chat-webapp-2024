# Serverless Chat Web App - AWS 2024 
## Shorena K. Anzhilov  

## Description:

This project showcases the architecture and design of Serverless Chat Web Application by leveraging various AWS services. The application serves static resources to users' browsers via AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) and uses JavaScript to dynamically modify web pages for an interactive user experience. It ensures secure access to resources by managing permissions and access policies with AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management).

AWS Lambda is employed to handle backend logic, allowing for the manipulation and processing of data in the cloud. To enhance client-side security, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is configured, providing necessary permissions to run serverless applications securely.

Data storage and retrieval are managed with DynamoDB, a highly scalable NoSQL database service. API Gateway is utilized to model APIs and automatically generate SDKs for seamless communication between client and server.

User authentication and management are handled by Amazon Cognito, providing a secure login system for users. To optimize performance, the application uses CloudFront, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), to accelerate content delivery and improve user experience.

## Technologies Implemented - Tech Stack:

- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Used for storing static HTML files and serving them to users' browsers.

- AWS Lambda: Executes backend logic in the cloud, facilitating the storage and retrieval of data within the application.

- AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manages and secures access to AWS services and resources.

- Amazon API Gateway: Provides a well-defined API for clients, including the ability to automatically generate client-side code for API communication.

- Amazon DynamoDB: Enables fast and scalable storage and retrieval of data.

- Amazon Cognito: Handles user management, including account creation, authentication, and secure login processes.

- Amazon CloudFront: Accelerates the delivery of web content to end users using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

- JavaScript: Utilized for front-end development.

- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Configured to manage client-side security by granting browsers the necessary permissions to interact with serverless functions.

- AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): Employed for dynamic web content updates and asynchronous data exchanges between the client and server.

- AWS SDK (Software Development Kit): Used for interacting with AWS services programmatically from the application.

## Highlights:  

This serverless chat application was created during my internship at AWS in 2024. The project holds a special place in my journey, serving as a reminder of the incredible experiences and growth I encountered during my time at AWS.

Working on this application allowed me to apply my skills in cloud architecture and serverless technologies while learning from some of the best in the field. It is not just a technical achievement but also a keepsake of the unforgettable memories, challenges overcome, and the invaluable knowledge gained. This project will always remind me of the remarkable team I worked with and the personal and professional growth I achieved during my internship.
